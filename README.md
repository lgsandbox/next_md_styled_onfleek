# ...ON FLEEK

This is the original nextjs/vercel demo version seen here modified for Fleek:

[https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/](https://next-blog-starter.vercel.app/)

&& this is the style free version:

[https://next-md.on.fleek.co/] (https://next-md.on.fleek.co/)

In this version it comes with a configured _document file for styled components, alongside some starter global styles to use.

To get started with the starter:

COMING SOON

npm install && npm run dev - and then do some CSS-in-JS magic to make it your own. 

If you want Tailwind (if you prefer that kinda <i>thing</i>) you can head over to the OG next demo after cloning the non styled version (both linked above), add the Tailwind/Next configs from the OG vercel deploy to the Fleek friendly version and you're good to go

When ready change the origin to your own repo, slap down all your git commands and do what must be done to "git" it to your GitHub. Yes I make funny, very good.

Then just point https://fleek.co/ to your repo and BAM just like that you can get back to your regularly scheduled JAM stack workflow, now on IPFS. Thanks Fleek!
